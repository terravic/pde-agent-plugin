"""`pde structure-screen` — bounded structure screening for Stage 0.

Retrieves existing structures/models within a declared screen budget,
runs pocket druggability analysis via the existing ``pde pocket``
contract, and produces ``pde.evidence-assessment.v1`` records with
relay codes and scoping preserved.

This is the structural screening component of Stage 0 (#22). It is NOT
a standalone Stage 0 implementation — it produces the structure-screening
piece that #22's dispatcher will later consume.

Design principles:

* **Retrieval, not prediction.** This bounded screen retrieves existing
  AlphaFold DB models or PDB structures. A new AF3 prediction is out of
  scope and requires separate cost/resource justification. Attempting to
  screen a target with no available structure produces a
  ``not_assessed``/``data_unavailable`` record, not a silent prediction.

* **Wraps, does not replace.** ``pocket-druggability/SKILL.md`` is the
  interpretation authority. This screening layer calls ``pde pocket``
  correctly, carries the relays and scoping through into assessment
  records, and never lets a screen-level "pass" imply more than the
  tool's own verdict supports.

* **No cross-target ranking by raw pocket score.** The drug score ranks
  conformations of one target or sites within one structure. Aggregating
  scores across different targets is explicitly forbidden by the existing
  skill contract and must not be reintroduced here.

* **Modality-aware scoping.** For modalities where pocket geometry is
  not the relevant tractability test (antibodies, biologics), the
  screening layer produces a ``not_yet_applicable`` assessment rather
  than forcing a pocket score onto an inapplicable modality.
