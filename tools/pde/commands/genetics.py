"""`pde genetics` — gnomAD constraint: is human loss of function tolerated?

Measured from observed human population data, not predicted. That is the
whole reason this tool is in the pilot: the tournament's safety arguments
were reaching for the question *what happens to people who lack this
gene?*, and gnomAD answers it by counting who exists.

Two phases:

  fetch    one gene -> the gnomAD GraphQL constraint record, written
           verbatim to Layer 0 with a sidecar.
  analyze  applies `gnomad-constraint@1.0` and returns lof_intolerant /
           lof_tolerant / indeterminate. No network.

Three things about the API shape a caller has to get right:

**gnomAD answers a failed query with HTTP 200.** `gene_symbol:"NOTAGENE"`
returns `{"errors":[{"message":"Gene not found"}],"data":{"gene":null}}`
with a 200 status. A client that checks only the status code writes an
artifact containing a null gene and reads it later as missing data. The
`errors` key is checked on every response.

**The same 200 also carries transient errors, and telling the two apart
is the whole job.** `{"errors":[{"message":"Service overloaded"}]}`
arrives with an identical status and an identical shape to "Gene not
found". The first cut of this file treated every `errors` entry as
permanent and duly reported that TP53 and KRAS do not exist — two genes
that plainly do — after five back-to-back queries at 1 qps. Hence
`TRANSIENT_ERRORS`, the retry loop, and `GNOMAD_QPS` well below 1.

The asymmetry is what makes this worth the retry budget. Misreading a
permanent error as transient wastes retries and then fails loudly.
Misreading a throttle as a permanent "not found" writes a clean artifact
saying the gene has no constraint data, and that is a fabricated
negative finding: a failure to answer is never an answer of no. See
tool-design-guidance §8, "HTTP status does not classify retryability, in
either direction".

**Symbol lookup is a lookup here, not a search** — gnomAD resolves one
symbol to one gene or to nothing — but the resolved `gene_id` is
recorded in the sidecar regardless, per tool-design-guidance §8.

The thresholds are gnomAD's own published recommendations rather than
convention. That matters more than usual here: the widely-quoted LOEUF
cutoff of 0.35 is the gnomAD **v2** figure, and the current
documentation states that o/e values are higher in v4 and that "any
LOEUF thresholds used on v2 will not give an equivalent number of genes
when applied to v4". The documented v4 recommendation is 0.45. Carrying
0.35 forward would silently reclassify genes in the 0.35-0.45 range.
