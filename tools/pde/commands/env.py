"""`pde env` — inspect, predict and write the environment stamp.

Iterating on the tools environment is cheap; iterating on it *blind* is
not, because every change partitions the artifacts written either side
of it (tool-design-guidance §2, Rule 4). These four subcommands exist so
the partition is visible before it happens, explainable after it
happens, and detectable when the environment has quietly stopped
matching its own stamp.

    pde env plan     what ENV_VERSION would become, and why
    pde env show     what it is now, and whether it still fits
    pde env stamp    write it, archiving the manifest and logging it
    pde env diff     what changed between two stamped versions

`plan` is the nimble half. An environment change you can price before
paying for it is a change you can schedule at a program boundary, which
is the whole of Rule 4's advice.
