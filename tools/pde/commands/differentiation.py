"""pde differentiation -- competitive differentiation assessment.

Produces structured competitive-differentiation findings that keep
three distinct dimensions separate:

  1. **Competitor activity** — what programs/compounds/publications
     exist for this target or modality+indication combination.
  2. **Patentability/novelty** — is there white space for new IP.
  3. **Freedom to operate (FTO)** — can the concept be pursued without
     infringing existing IP.

These dimensions are NEVER blended into a single score.  Each carries:
  - search date
  - search scope (what was queried)
  - coverage limits (what was NOT covered)

Every patent-related finding carries an explicit disclaimer that a
public/structural search is **not formal legal clearance** and that
material FTO conclusions require qualified review.

Two phases:

  assess         reads stored patent search results and concept
                 context, produces a three-dimension assessment.
                 No network.
  report         formats the assessment as evidence-assessment
                 records (``pde.evidence-assessment.v1``).
                 No network.

Usage with the patent tool::

    pde patent search "CDK4 inhibitor"
    pde differentiation assess CDK4 --concept IC-001 --indication solid_tumors --modality small_molecule
    pde differentiation report CDK4 --concept IC-001
