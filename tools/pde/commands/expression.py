"""`pde expression` — measured human RNA expression from the Human Protein Atlas.

This tool answers one question and refuses the neighbouring ones: *has
somebody measured how much of this transcript is present in this tissue?*
It does not predict, it does not rank targets, and it does not decide
whether an expression level is therapeutically interesting.

Two phases (docs/tool-design-guidance.md §3):

  fetch    one gene -> the HPA per-gene annotation record plus the full
           50-tissue consensus nTPM profile, written verbatim to Layer 0
           with a provenance sidecar. No judgment, no cutoffs.
  analyze  reads those artifacts from disk, applies the named
           `expression` threshold set, emits a per-tissue verdict.
           Never touches the network.

Three properties of the HPA API drive most of the code below, and each
one silently manufactures a wrong answer if it is not handled:

1. **`search_download.php` is a search, not a lookup.** `search=WEE1`
   returns two genes — WEE1 (ENSG00000166483) and WEE1B/WEE2
   (ENSG00000214102) — and a caller taking the first row gets whichever
   HPA ranked highest. We resolve symbols separately, demand exactly one
   exact match, and then query by Ensembl ID, which does return one row.

2. **Invalid tissue columns vanish silently.** `t_RNA_not_a_tissue`
   produces no error and no column; the response is simply narrower.
   Eight plausible names (`skin`, `stomach`, `endometrium`,
   `hypophysis`, `medulla_oblongata`, `pons`, `white_matter`,
   `thalamus`) drop this way. A tool that did not check would report
   "not measured in skin" for a gene HPA measures at 55.1 nTPM in
   `skin 1`. Every requested column is verified present in the response.

3. **The per-gene JSON carries only *specific* nTPM values.** For a
   tissue-enriched gene it lists the enriched tissues and nothing else;
   for a low-specificity gene the field is `null`. Absence from that
   dict is not absence of expression, so the full profile is fetched
   separately rather than inferred from the record.

4. **Single-cell columns return null, not zero.** Unlike the tissue
   profile (which always returns a numeric string for all 50 columns),
   the single-cell profile returns `null` for cell types where a gene
   has no measured expression. The column is present — proving the
   column code was accepted — but carries no value. This is recorded
   as 0.0 nCPM, not treated as an error.

HPA exposes no release version through the API — not in the body, not in
the headers. We scrape it from `/about/download` as a convenience label
and anchor provenance on the SHA-256 of the exact response payload
instead, which the sidecar records for every output. If the scrape
fails we still write the artifact and relay
`expression.release_version_unknown`: the measurement is real and
nothing is invented, and `analyze` re-runs from the stored bytes, so
what is lost is comparability across releases rather than
reproducibility.
