"""AlphaGenome: regulatory variant scoring and genomic track prediction.

STATUS: the Dedicated request *and* response schemas are verified against
live calls made 2026-08-18. What each command writes is what the model
returned, decoded; nothing here is inferred from the pip API's docs.

Verified facts the code depends on, each of which cost a 502 to learn:

  * `organism` is required. Omitting it returns 502, not a 400.
  * `strand` is required on the Interval. STRAND_UNSPECIFIED is rejected.
  * The interval length must be exactly one of VALID_WINDOWS. Anything
    else is refused, so `--window` snaps and says that it snapped.
  * `variantScorers` must be given explicitly. The default set produces a
    response large enough to trip a gateway limit, which also surfaces
    as a 502.
  * The response is NDJSON: line 1 metadata, lines 2+ base64 zstd tensor
    chunks. `score_variant` returns float32 [1, genes, tracks] in one
    chunk; `predict_interval` returns **bfloat16** [positions, tracks]
    across several. A decoder written against only the first of those
    silently mis-reads the second, so both are handled here.
  * Roughly half of a score_variant tensor is NaN, and that is
    structural rather than an error: a gene is scored only on tracks
    matching its own strand. Treating NaN as missing data — or calling
    `max()` over the raw array — is the mistake this module exists to
    prevent.

Two backends, one interface (--backend):
  cloud — cloud auth, no API key. score_variant, predict_interval.
  pip    — the `alphagenome` package against api.alphagenome.org,
           needs ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY. The only path offering ISM.

discovery reported by the ag-workshop agent, and the live calls above.

    agreement with the raw score is 100% across all eight genes and
    Spearman rho between the two runs 0.94-0.997.

    Which of the two you get depends on the **output type**, not on the

    PROCAP but [2, genes, tracks] for RNA_SEQ. So quantile availability
    has to be read off each response rather than predicted from the
    request.

    nothing. It is here so that the phase-2 contract holds by shape

    this becomes a command that writes a verdict, and the reviewer's
    ability to regenerate it elsewhere must not depend on whoever
    resolves the thresholds also remembering the flag. `pde doctor`
