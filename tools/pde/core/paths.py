"""Security helpers for path confinement and slug sanitization.

These utilities are the shared foundation for preventing path-traversal and
symlink-exploitation vulnerabilities across the PDE toolchain.  Every
command that builds a filesystem path from user-controlled input should
use ``confine_path`` and/or ``sanitize_slug`` rather than rolling its own
checks.

Functions
---------
confine_path
    Resolve a path and verify it stays within a base directory.
sanitize_slug
    Make a user-controlled string safe for use in filenames.
is_safe_to_open
    Guard against opening symlinks unless explicitly allowed.
