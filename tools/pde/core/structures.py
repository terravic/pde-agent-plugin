"""Shared structure-format detection for PDB and mmCIF files.

Every structure-consuming tool in this CLI needs to answer "is this PDB
or mmCIF?" at least once before it can do anything useful.  Before this
module existed, each tool answered the question independently and
differently, and every new tool rediscovered the gap (see #19 and #33).

**Detection vs. handling are deliberately separate.**  What a tool does
once it knows the format depends on the tool, not on the format:

  pocket.py   Dispatch to ``_parse_residues_pdb()`` or
              ``_parse_residues_cif()`` — the tool must parse atom
              coordinates natively, so it needs a format-specific
              parser per format.

  docking.py  Pass the file to ``mk_prepare_receptor.py --read_with_prody``,
              which handles both PDB and mmCIF transparently via ProDy.
              The tool does not need to know the format for parsing, but
              may use ``detect_structure_format()`` for early validation
              (fail with a clear error before launching a subprocess that
              would produce an opaque one).

A future tool should check this module first: either reuse
``detect_structure_format()`` to dispatch format-specific logic, or
discover that the downstream tool already handles both formats natively
and skip format-specific logic entirely.

    Uses a two-stage strategy:

    1. **Extension hint** — ``.pdb``/``.ent`` → PDB, ``.cif``/``.mmcif`` → CIF.
    2. **Content sniff** — reads the first ~200 kB of the file and looks
       for characteristic tokens.  mmCIF files use ``data_``, ``loop_``,
       and ``_atom_site.*`` block/loop syntax; PDB files use fixed-width
       ``ATOM``/``HETATM``/``HEADER`` records without CIF's syntax.

    If the extension gives a clear answer and the content does not
    contradict it, the extension wins (fast path).  If the extension is
    absent or unrecognised, content alone decides.  If the content
    contradicts the extension, content wins (a mislabelled file should
    not silently misparse — see ``pocket.py``'s ``_is_experimental()``,
    which reads file content rather than trusting a name).
