"""Provenance sidecars and analysis records.

Every phase-1 artifact gets `<name>.meta.json` beside it; every phase-2
run emits `<name>.analysis.json` citing its source and the threshold set
applied. See docs/tool-design-guidance.md §5.

`warnings` on the sidecar is load-bearing: warnings that must reach the
report are captured here so a reviewer can confirm the specialist
relayed them.

Some warnings are stronger than that. A warning carrying a `relay` code
is a **mandatory relay** in the sense of skill-design-guidance §4.5: it
must reach the Layer 1 finding unchanged, because a report that omits it
is wrong rather than merely incomplete. Isoform substitution is the
model case — the numbers describe a different molecule than the one the
finding names.

These carry a stable code (`afdb.partial_coverage`) as well as prose.
The code is what makes the reviewer check mechanical: prose is rewritten
between builds and cannot be matched on, but a skill can name a code and
a reviewer can enumerate the codes in an artifact and confirm each was
addressed. Codes are registered in RELAY_CODES so the set is
discoverable rather than scattered across call sites.

    anyone noticing, so exclude it only if losing it costs nothing.)

    Rewriting an identical record buys a fresher timestamp and pays with
    the first author's name. Not writing keeps both the attribution and,
    just as usefully, the bytes: a reviewer's confirming run now leaves
    `raw/` untouched, so a checksum sweep over the evidence still reads
    clean afterwards. That is why this is (a) — do not write — rather
    than appending the confirming agent to the record. Appending would
    preserve more, but it would also mutate the artifact under audit,
    and an integrity sweep cannot tell a benign append from tampering.

    An unreadable or non-conforming file is treated as a conflict. It
    cannot be shown to agree, and "could not check" must not resolve to
    "went ahead" — that is the shape of every fabrication this
    architecture is built to prevent.
