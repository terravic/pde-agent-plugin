"""Stdout discipline.

Tools write outputs and share paths. They do not stream content into
context. See docs/tool-design-guidance.md §6.

Budget:
  fetch / run  -> the output paths, one per line, nothing else
  analyze      -> a bounded human summary, hard-capped
  anything more-> to file, with the path printed

The cap is enforced here, in shared code, so no subcommand can exceed it.
