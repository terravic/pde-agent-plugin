"""Named, versioned thresholds — the numbers that decide things.

Thresholds live in code, never as prose and never as inline literals at
a call site (docs/tool-design-guidance.md §7). Resolution is three
levels, most specific wins:

  1. defaults declared here, carrying a version tag
  2. program overrides in <project>/.pde/thresholds.yaml
  3. per-invocation override flags, recorded in the sidecar

Every `.analysis.json` names the `threshold_set` it applied, so a Layer 1
finding can cite the criterion and not merely the value.

UNRESOLVED thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A threshold whose defensible value we do not have is declared as
``UNRESOLVED`` rather than filled with a plausible number. Requesting an
unresolved threshold raises `ThresholdError`, which turns "invented
cutoff" into "blocked task".

This is intentional and should be treated as a legitimate terminal
state (tool-design-guidance.md §7).  An UNRESOLVED threshold must only
be resolved when a citable, peer-reviewed or authoritative source
becomes available.  Do NOT fill in "reasonable-looking" numbers: a
plausible guess behind a negative claim about a drug target is the
precise failure mode this sentinel exists to prevent.

The ``ThresholdSet.unresolved()`` method lists which keys remain
UNRESOLVED, and ``pde doctor`` surfaces them at agent start so the
gap is visible without inventing a fix.  Programs that have their own
defensible cutoffs can supply them via ``.pde/thresholds.yaml``
without modifying this file.

# tool-design-guidance.md §7: "An unresolved threshold is a legitimate
# terminal state. Where a source publishes no cutoff for a quantity, the
# tool must not supply one."
#
# Declaring the set despite all values being UNRESOLVED serves two
# purposes:
#   1. Program-level overrides via .pde/thresholds.yaml can fill in
#      site-specific values when a program has its own defensible cutoffs.
#   2. The analysis artifact records the threshold set name and its
#      unresolved status, making the absence of classification explicit
#      and machine-readable rather than implicit.
#

#   GTEx reports median TPM from bulk RNA-seq of 755 whole-blood samples
#   (femoral/subclavian veins). HPA reports consensus nTPM (normalized
#   Transcripts Per Million) from its own pipeline across ~50 tissues.
#   The two units are not directly comparable: nTPM applies HPA-specific
#   normalization that adjusts for transcript length and library
#   composition differently from standard TPM. A gene at 5.0 TPM in GTEx
#   and 5.0 nTPM in HPA is not the same measurement, and blending them

# --- gnomAD constraint ------------------------------------------------------
# Every resolved value is gnomAD's own published recommendation, quoted
# from gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/constraint (source of record:
# broadinstitute/gnomad-browser browser/help/topics/constraint.md):
#
#   "Since `pLI` > 0.9 is widely used in research and clinical
#    interpretation of Mendelian cases, we suggest using the upper bound
#    of the `oe` confidence interval (which we term ... `LOEUF`) < 0.45
#    if a hard threshold is needed."
#
#   "Intermediate `pLI` scores (0.1-0.9) are typically an indication that
#    the gene was too small to be confidently categorized."
#
# The LOEUF cutoff is 0.45 and not the widely-quoted 0.35. 0.35 is the
# gnomAD v2 figure, and the current documentation says o/e values are
# higher in v4 and that "any `LOEUF` thresholds used on v2 will not give
# an equivalent number of genes when applied to v4". Carrying 0.35
# forward would misclassify genes near the boundary — any gene with
# LOEUF between 0.35 and 0.45 changes classification.
#
# pli_indeterminate_floor is the lower edge of gnomAD's documented
# too-small-to-categorise band. It is what `gnomad.constraint_unreliable`
# fires on, which means the unreliability call rests on a cited
# criterion rather than on a gene-size rule of thumb.
#
# loeuf_unreliable_min_expected_lof is UNRESOLVED. A minimum expected-LoF
# count below which LOEUF should be distrusted is a real and widely-used
# idea, but gnomAD publishes no such number — it says instead that "it is
# essential to take the 90% CI into consideration". `analyze` therefore
# reports exp_lof and the full CI and declines to threshold on them.

# --- fpocket druggability ---------------------------------------------------
# The drug score is Schmidtke & Barril's logistic model over pocket
# descriptors, trained to separate druggable from non-druggable sites;
# it returns a value in [0,1] and 0.5 is its decision boundary. The
# borderline floor below it is ours and is labelled as such — the paper
# defines one boundary, not a band, and inventing a citation for the
# second number would be worse than owning it.
#
# `volume_estimate_tolerance` is measured, not cited. fpocket computes
# pocket volume by Monte Carlo integration seeded from the clock and
# offers no seed flag, so the same input gives different volumes on
# different runs. Five runs over 1UYD on 2026-08-18 spanned 1415.9-1448.6
# Å3, a 2.3% range; 0.05 is that rounded up. Two runs whose volumes
# differ by less than this have not disagreed about anything.
#
# Consecutive runs inside the same second return identical numbers,
# because the seed is time(NULL) at one-second resolution. A
# reproducibility check run as a tight loop therefore reports perfect
# determinism, which is the trap this note exists to spring.
#
# `druggable_dscore` is a real boundary that cannot be read as a verdict
# about a target, and the difference matters more here than the number
# does. Measured on 2026-08-18 against four crystal structures of two
# sites that are drugged in the clinic:
#
#     CDK2 ATP site   1HCK (ATP)            0.939
#                     2W1D (inhibitor)      0.293
#                     1AQ1 (staurosporine)  0.172
#     HSP90 ATP site  1UYD (inhibitor)      0.855
#
# One site, three CDK2 structures, and a 0.77 spread that crosses the
# boundary twice. The score is dominated by the conformation it was
# measured in, so a single structure scoring under 0.5 is evidence about
# that structure and nothing more. This is why a sub-cutoff verdict
# leaves `pde pocket analyze` with a mandatory relay attached
# (`fpocket.single_conformation`) and why the verdict itself is named
# `no-druggable-pocket-in-this-conformation`: the qualifier has to be
# carried by the machine-readable field, because the one place it will
# not survive is a summary written by someone who wanted a yes.
#
# Read the cutoff as a ranking aid across conformations of one target,
# or across candidate sites in one structure. Do not read it as a gate
# on whether a target is tractable.
