"""Manufacturing assessment logic — progressive stage-gated evaluation.

Stage 0 (qualitative, no external APIs):
  Assess production-platform fit for a concept record using modality,
  delivery_assumptions, and entity_ref.

The assessment logic lives here in ``core/`` — separate from the CLI
commands in ``commands/manufacturing.py`` — following the project's
existing pattern: core modules hold domain logic; command modules are
thin CLI wrappers.

Hard constraints:
  - SA-score != synthesizability.  A good SA-score is a cheap heuristic
    about fragment frequency, not evidence of a scalable process.
  - Stereocenter/step counts are scoped heuristics, not vetoes.
  - No fabrication of yield, cost of goods, stability, or formulation.
  - Qualitative findings cite precedent, assumptions, limitations, owner,
    and the next required evidence.

Stage definitions (progressive requirements):
  Stage 0: product/modality/delivery and production-platform fit
  Stage 2: entity/route or therapeutic-sequence feasibility
  Stage 3: formulation/process/developability evidence
  Stage 4: supply and applicable readiness evidence
