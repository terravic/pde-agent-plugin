    code"):

      answer   exit 0    the analysis completed; act on it
      refusal  exit 9    change the input; the same query will always
                         be declined
      failure  exit 6/7  keep the input; the fault is elsewhere and may

    Every tool that resolves a name will have one of these, because
    never-rank-and-pick guarantees it: the ambiguous case is a refusal
    by construction. It must not depend on which tool was asked, which
    is why this lives here rather than as a per-command exit constant.
    Before this existed, `litref analyze` on an ambiguous name and
    `expression fetch` on an ambiguous symbol — the same outcome —
    exited 7 and 6 respectively, and 7 already meant "retry later",
    the opposite remedy.

    Raising this does not suppress output. A refusal that has produced
    an analysis artifact still prints its path first; the artifact
    records what was refused and why.
