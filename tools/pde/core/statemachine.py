"""State machine definitions for work-order and run lifecycles.

Two state machines govern the control plane:

**Work-order state machine** tracks a work order from initial proposal
through specialist execution, mechanical validation, and scientific
review to a terminal state.  The ``validation_failed → in_progress``
transition is the recovery path for contract failures (§9 of
orchestration-design-guidance.md: "contract failure → return for
correction").  Without it, every validation failure — a missing sidecar,
a wrong path — would require creating an entirely new work-order
revision, which is too heavyweight for mechanical issues.

The ``validation_failed → mechanically_validated`` transition is the
override path for hand-verified work orders (#178).  When specific
checks fail but the underlying property has been verified by alternative
means, an operator can override named checks (from a hardcoded
allow-list) with a required justification and evidence link.  The
override is recorded in the event log and as append-only history on the
work-order record; the original validation record is never modified.

**Run state machine** tracks a single execution attempt against a
committed work-order revision, from queuing through completion or
failure.

Both machines live in one module because they are interleaved: run
creation validates that the referenced work order is in a state that
permits queuing, and run completion may trigger work-order transitions.
Splitting definitions across command modules would create cross-module
imports for the common case.

Illegal transitions raise ``Refusal`` (exit 9) — the same code used
elsewhere in the CLI for "change the input; retrying cannot help."
