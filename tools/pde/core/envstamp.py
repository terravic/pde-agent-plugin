"""What the environment is, written as one file you can read.

`ENV_VERSION` goes into every provenance sidecar, so it partitions a
program's artifacts: results produced under two different values are not
comparable without an argument (tool-design-guidance §2, Rule 4). A
partition is only bearable if it can be *explained* — "these two numbers
came from different environments" is useless unless someone can say what
differed.

So the stamp is not a hash of something ephemeral. It is the hash of
`env-manifest.txt`, a plain-text document listing the interpreter, every
installed package, and every file in `bin/` with its own digest. The
document contains no timestamp and no path, so the same environment
produces the same bytes on any day in any container; and because each
stamped manifest is archived under its own hash, the difference between
two `env_version` values is a diff anyone can run months later.

The previous stamp hashed `pip freeze` alone. Under that rule, adding a
compiled binary to `bin/` — a change that alters what the tools *do* —
produced no change in the value that claims to identify the environment.
An identifier that misses the change you made is worse than no
identifier, because artifacts then carry a false claim of comparability.

    identifies the environment: the interpreter, the packages, the
    binaries. Folding the source commit into it would make every
    documentation commit bump the value and partition the program's
    artifacts over a change that alters nothing an artifact depends on.
    That is the exact mirror of the defect this module was written to
    fix — an identifier that fires on what does not matter is as useless
    as one that misses what does, and it is worse in practice, because
    people learn to ignore it.

    The commit is recorded *beside* the stamp instead, because it
    answers a different question: not "what is this environment?" but
    "can anyone else obtain the thing that built it?"

    `on_origin` is the one that matters. The shared volume is immediate
    and the repository is eventual, so a stamp written from an unpushed
    tree describes an environment built from something nobody else can
    fetch. Artifacts carrying it are not wrong, but they are not
    re-derivable, which is the property the two-phase contract exists to
    provide.

    `dirty` and `dirty_inputs` are not the same question, and only the
    second is worth waking anyone for. Five agents share this working
    tree, so at any moment somebody has an uncommitted file in it, and
    warning on that would light permanently for changes the reader did
    not make and cannot fix. Whether a checker script is committed has
    no bearing on whether this environment can be rebuilt. Whether
    `install.sh` is committed has every bearing on it.
