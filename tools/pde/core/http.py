"""Shared HTTP client: rate limiting and retry in one place.

Not re-implemented per subcommand, and not requested of the agent in
prose (docs/tool-design-guidance.md §8).

Error bodies are returned, not just codes — an agent can act on
"429, retry after 300s"; it cannot act on "request failed".

Pacing state is persisted to disk with ``flock(2)`` so that the
minimum interval between requests to a given host is honoured across
CLI invocations (not only within a single process).  When a shared
filesystem volume is available (``.pde/scratchpad/pace`` or
an explicit ``PDE_PACE_DIR``), cross-container coordination is active
and multiple agents on the same host observe the per-host interval.
When falling back to container-local pacing (``~/.cache/pde/pace``),
cross-container coordination is NOT covered — each container enforces
the interval independently.
