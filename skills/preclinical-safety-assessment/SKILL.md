description: "Interpret preclinical toxicology studies, compute therapeutic index and hERG safety margins, and assess genotoxicity batteries -- repeat-dose study data, cross-artifact margin calculation, ICH S2(R1) weight-of- evidence genotoxicity assessment, and safety pharmacology recording. Use when interpreting tox study results for safety margin evaluation, computing therapeutic index from NOAEL exposure and PK data, assessing a genotoxicity battery, or evaluating measured hERG IC50 margins. Do not use for predicted ADMET endpoints (use admet-property-prediction), for in vivo PK parameters or NCA analysis (use in-vivo-pk-analysis, though PK data is a required input here), or for compound drug-likeness rules and structural alerts (use compound-property-profile)."

## 1. When to use, and when not

Use this skill when you need to interpret preclinical toxicology data
and compute safety margins. Entry points include:

- Ingesting and normalising repeat-dose, safety pharmacology, or
  genotoxicity study data for downstream analysis.
- Computing therapeutic index (TI) from NOAEL exposure and PK NCA
  data — cross-artifact margin calculation requiring both tox and PK
  artifacts.
- Assessing a genotoxicity battery using ICH S2(R1) weight-of-evidence
  classification.
- Computing measured hERG IC50 safety margins from safety pharmacology
  data and PK exposure.
- Applying the `tox-safety-package` threshold set to produce verdicts
  on margins, genotoxicity, or safety pharmacology artifacts.

**Do not use when:**

- You need predicted ADMET endpoints (metabolic stability, permeability,
  predicted hERG structural flag) -> `admet-property-prediction`.
- You need in vivo PK parameters, NCA analysis, or allometric scaling
  -> `in-vivo-pk-analysis` (though PK NCA artifacts are a required
  input for margin calculation here).
- You need compound drug-likeness rules or structural alerts
  -> `compound-property-profile`.

## 2. Preconditions

- **Input schemas**: canonical JSON matching one of:
  - `pde.tox-repeat-dose.v1` — repeat-dose study data (for ingest,
    margins).
  - `pde.tox-safety-pharm.v1` — safety pharmacology data with
    measured hERG IC50 (for ingest, margins `--herg`, analyze).
  - `pde.tox-genotox.v1` — genotoxicity battery results (for ingest,
    genotox).
- **Cross-artifact dependency**: `tox margins` requires BOTH a tox
  repeat-dose artifact AND a PK NCA artifact (`pde.pk-nca.v1`,
  produced by `in-vivo-pk-analysis`). Optionally takes a safety-pharm
  artifact via `--herg` for measured hERG IC50 margin calculation.
  PK data is a precondition for margin computation — run
  `in-vivo-pk-analysis` first.
- **`pde doctor`**: run before first use. It ends with a verdict
  line: `STOP` means fix or report; `PROCEED` means work.
- **No authentication** needed — all operations are local.
- **No network** — all subcommands are offline.

## 3. Tool invocations

| Question | Run | Writes to |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest and normalise a tox study? | `pde tox ingest <INPUT_FILE>` | `raw/tox/{id}.tox-repeat-dose.json` + `.meta.json`<br>`raw/tox/{id}.tox-safety-pharm.json` + `.meta.json`<br>`raw/tox/{id}.tox-genotox.json` + `.meta.json` |
| Assess a genotoxicity battery? | `pde tox genotox <GENOTOX_ARTIFACT>` | `raw/tox/{compound_id}.tox-genotox-assessment.json` + `.meta.json` |
| Compute therapeutic index and hERG margins? | `pde tox margins <TOX_FILE> <PK_FILE> [--herg <SAFETY_PHARM>]` | `raw/tox/{study_id}.tox-margins.json` + `.meta.json` |
| Apply thresholds and produce verdict? | `pde tox analyze <ARTIFACT>` | `raw/tox/{stem}.tox.analysis.json` |

Run phase 1 (`ingest`, `genotox`, `margins`) before phase 2
(`analyze`). `analyze` reads from disk and can be re-run with different
thresholds without recomputing.

`ingest` dispatches on the `schema` field in the input JSON — one
command handles all three study types.

## 4. Interpretation contract

### Verdicts

`analyze` applies the `tox-safety-package@1.0` threshold set and
emits per-artifact-type verdicts:

**Margins analysis** (`pde.tox-margins.v1`):
- **acceptable** — TI and hERG margins (when present) meet thresholds.
- **flagged** — one or more margins below threshold.
- **incomplete** — NOAEL exposure data not available; TI cannot be
  computed.

**Genotox analysis** (`pde.tox-genotox-assessment.v1`):
- **acceptable** — battery negative, no genotoxic concern.
- **flagged_equivocal** — mixed results, in vitro positive / in vivo
  negative pattern (equivocal).
- **flagged_concern** — positive or mixed results indicating genotoxic
  concern (includes all-positive, in vivo positive, or preponderance
  positive batteries).
- **unknown** — battery verdict not classifiable.

**Safety-pharm analysis** (`pde.tox-safety-pharm.v1`):
- **recorded** — safety pharmacology data recorded. Quantitative hERG
  margin requires running `tox margins` with both PK and safety-pharm
  artifacts.

### Genotox battery classification

`tox genotox` classifies the battery result per ICH S2(R1):
- **negative** — all assays negative.
- **positive** — all assays positive.
- **equivocal** — in vitro positive / in vivo negative (WoE needed).
- **concern** — in vivo micronucleus positive with mixed results
  (WoE needed).
- **positive_concern** — 2+ positive results in a mixed battery
  (WoE needed).

### Thresholds

The `tox-safety-package@1.0` threshold set provides:
- `ti_minimum` — minimum acceptable therapeutic index fold-margin
  (ICH M3(R2)).
- `herg_safety_margin` — minimum hERG safety margin fold (ICH S7B).
- `herg_marginal` — operational boundary below the full hERG margin.
- `noael_exposure_margin` — **UNRESOLVED**. This threshold has no
  defensible default value. It is entirely program-specific. Do not
  invent a value — set it via `.pde/thresholds.yaml` per program
  and record the justification.

Thresholds are cited by name. The values in force are in the artifact:
every `.analysis.json` carries `threshold_set`, `thresholds_applied`,
`threshold_sources`, and `threshold_provenance`. Quote values from the
analysis being cited, never from prose.

### Mandatory relays

| Relay code | Kind | Fires when | Obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tox.genotox_weight_of_evidence` | Qualifier | Genotox battery has mixed results requiring weight-of-evidence reasoning (conditional) | State that this genotoxicity assessment used ICH S2(R1) weight-of-evidence reasoning because the battery results were mixed. Do not report the verdict as a clean negative — name the positive assay and the basis for the overall assessment. |

**Upstream relay forwarding.** `tox margins` reads the PK NCA sidecar
and forwards any upstream mandatory relays (e.g.,
`pk.nca_assumes_linearity`). Any upstream relay present in the margins
`.meta.json` must also be satisfied in the finding. Check
`mandatory_relays` in both the `.analysis.json` and in each phase-1
`.meta.json`.

### Consequence rules

- **Margins acceptable**: state the verdict, the threshold set, and
  which margins were computed (TI Cmax, TI AUC, hERG). Proceed to
  downstream work.
- **Margins flagged**: state which margins are below threshold and by
  how much (from the analysis, not from recomputation). A flagged TI
  below the configured `ti_minimum` is a substantive safety concern.
  A flagged hERG margin between `herg_marginal` and
  `herg_safety_margin` warrants attention; below `herg_marginal` is
  elevated concern.
- **Margins incomplete**: NOAEL exposure data was absent. The NOAEL
  dose is recorded but TI cannot be computed without measured exposure.
  This is not a failure — it is a data gap that requires toxicokinetic
  (TK) data.
- **Genotox acceptable**: battery negative, no genotoxic concern.
- **Genotox flagged**: state the battery classification and the
  weight-of-evidence basis. Satisfy the
  `tox.genotox_weight_of_evidence` relay if present.
- **Safety-pharm recorded**: data is recorded but quantitative margin
  assessment requires running `tox margins` with both PK and
  safety-pharm artifacts.

### Stage 3 to Stage 4 boundary

When a safety-pharm artifact with measured hERG IC50 is available, the
measured hERG margin from `tox margins` supersedes the predicted
structural flag from Stage 3 ADMET (`admet.herg_structural_flag`). A
measured IC50 and computed safety margin are direct evidence; a
pharmacophore-based prediction is indirect. Do not carry both the
measured margin and the predicted flag as independent findings — the
measured margin replaces the prediction.

### Cross-disciplinary consequences

- The therapeutic index assumes the PK file represents exposure at the
  intended therapeutic dose. `pde.pk-nca.v1` does not tag dose
  context — this assumption cannot be verified from the artifact alone.
- A margins artifact without hERG data does not imply hERG safety —
  it means the measurement was not provided.
- Genotox battery classification is categorical. No threshold
  application occurs for genotox — the verdict maps directly from the
  battery result pattern.
- Safety-pharm data recording does not substitute for quantitative
  margin calculation. The hERG IC50 value is captured but not compared
  to therapeutic exposure until `tox margins` is run with both
  artifacts.

## 5. Failure modes and anti-fabrication guard

**Do not compute these values yourself.** The value is whatever the
tool emitted. If the tool did not run, there is no value. If a
required tool is unavailable, report the task as blocked. Do not
estimate, and do not proceed on an assumed result.

### Named pathologies

- **Computing TI without PK data.** `tox margins` requires both a
  tox repeat-dose artifact and a PK NCA artifact. Do not estimate a
  therapeutic index from the NOAEL dose alone — exposure-based TI
  requires measured exposure data.
- **Treating an incomplete margins verdict as acceptable.** Incomplete
  means TI could not be computed, not that the margin is adequate. A
  missing TI is a data gap, not a pass.
- **Reporting a mixed genotox battery as negative.** When the
  `tox.genotox_weight_of_evidence` relay fires, the battery had mixed
  results. The verdict is the classification after WoE reasoning, not
  a clean negative.
- **Carrying both predicted and measured hERG findings.** When a
  measured hERG IC50 margin is available from `tox margins`, it
  supersedes `admet.herg_structural_flag`. Do not present both as
  independent lines of evidence.
- **Ignoring upstream PK relays on the margins artifact.** `tox margins`
  forwards upstream relays from the PK sidecar (e.g.,
  `pk.nca_assumes_linearity`). Every forwarded relay must be satisfied
  in the finding — they are not tox-specific, but they apply to the
  TI calculation that depends on the PK data.
- **Inventing a value for `noael_exposure_margin`.** This threshold is
  UNRESOLVED and program-specific. The CLI will refuse to apply it.
  Do not supply a value in prose or in a finding.
